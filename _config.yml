  caption: '**Architecture of LUCI**. Given user instruction and the conversational context, the Tool Selector first selects a tool from the given GUI toolset and opens the applications. The conversational model then generates a solution outline, which is a text description of the list of sub-tasks needed to solve the task. Next, the Task Verifier filters redundant tasks in the solution outline based on action feedback from previously executed tasks and future sub-tasks. Then, a rule-based UI Extractor extracts UI elements from the GUI application. UI Selector selects appropriate UI elements from the list of UI elements generated by the UI extractor for the given sub-task. Lastly, the Action Executor performs an action on the selected UI element based on the type of UI element and generates the action feedback'
